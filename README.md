## A) Clustering
The objective is to cluster families based on their spending behaviors, income, and cost structures. Key features include family size, housing, food, and transportation costs, as well as total expenses. This analysis enables tailored financial advice, targeted policy-making, and effective business strategies. 

## B) Fitting
The objective is to analyze literacy rate trends over time for the overall population, and separately for males and females. By fitting curves to this data, we aim to identify gender differences and observe overall progress. This analysis will highlight the impact of gender on literacy rates. It will also help track progress toward education-related goals.
